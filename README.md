# Covid-19 Vaccine Notification

Resuable LWC dataTable that will enhance your solution building speed.
It is displaying tabular data where each column renders the content based on the data type.Here individuals data is displayed in the form of datatable built on LWC and has columns such as Name,Age,Geo and Email, Nearest  Vaccination Center.

## Introduction
This repo showcases the best defaults for creating rich,interactive data-dense UI's using the following Centerpieces-

1.	lightning-datatable from [LWC](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-datatable/documentation).
2.	[Refresh-apex](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc/lwc.apex_result_caching) from LWC
3.	Process builder
4.	Email-Alerts


Salesforce has invested heavily into LWC, Flow , Screen Flow and has given [Architect Guidance](https://architect.salesforce.com/design/decision-guides/build-forms/) around how to build scalable and flexible solutions now and into the future.

This repo builds on that guidance and pushes data-dense UI design to the next level with highly reusable, highly configurable components. These components has allowed me to pivot on a dime to meet the changing speed of business.

## Motivation

The components found in this repo aim to solve these high level problems:

Complex component communication can be difficult to design with consistency.
Datatables are useful but high effort to use.
Modals / Dialogs are useful but high effort to use.
